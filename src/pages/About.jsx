        Everything you should know about CAPSULES!
      </h1>
      <p className="py-12">
        A space capsule is a spacecraft designed to transport cargo, scientific
        experiments, and/or astronauts to and from space.First Capsules are
        distinguished from other spacecraft by the ability to survive reentry
        and return a payload to the Earth's surface from orbit or sub-orbit, and
        are distinguished from other types of recoverable spacecraft by their
        blunt shape, not having wings and often containing little fuel other
        than what is necessary for a safe return. Capsule-based crewed
        spacecraft such as Soyuz or Orion are often supported by a service or
        adapter module, and sometimes augmented with an extra module for
        extended space operations. Capsules make up the majority of crewed
        spacecraft designs, although one crewed spaceplane, the Space Shuttle,
        has flown in orbit. Current examples of crewed space capsules include
        Soyuz, Shenzhou, and Dragon 2. Examples of new crew capsules currently
        in development include NASA's Orion, Boeing's Starliner, Russia's Orel,
        India's Gaganyaan, and China's next-generation crewed spacecraft.
        Historic examples of crewed capsules include Vostok, Mercury, Voskhod,
        Gemini, and Apollo, and active programs include the New Shepard
        launches. A crewed space capsule must be able to sustain life in an
        often demanding thermal and radiation environment in the vacuum of
        space. It may be expendable (used once, like Soyuz) or reusable (like
        Crew Dragon).

      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-20">Dragon 1</h1>
      <p className="py-6">
        Dragon 1 was the original Dragon iteration, providing cargo service to
        the ISS. It flew 23 missions between 2010 and 2020, when it was retired.
        On May 25, 2012, NASA astronaut Don Pettit operated the Canadarm2 to
        grapple the first SpaceX Dragon and berth it to the Harmony module. This
        marked the first time a private spacecraft had ever rendezvoused with
        the ISS. The Dragon capsule was carrying supplies for the ISS, and the
        successful capture demonstrated the feasibility of using privately
        developed spacecraft to resupply the station. Pettit was also the first
        to enter the uncrewed supply ship on May 26, making him the first
        astronaut in the history of space exploration to successfully enter a
        commercially-built and operated spacecraft in orbit. During the capture,
        he was quoted saying, "Houston, Station, we've got us a dragon by the
        tail."

      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-20">Dragon 2</h1>
      <p className="py-6">
        The seven-seat SpaceX Dragon 2 capsule first launched crew to the
        International Space Station on 30 May 2020 on the Demo-2 mission for
        NASA. Although originally envisaged as a development of SpaceX's
        uncrewed Dragon capsule which was used for the NASA Commercial Resupply
        Services contract, the demands of crewed spaceflight resulted in a
        significantly redesigned vehicle with limited commonality. The Dragon
        capsule was designed to be reusable. In fact, SpaceX has flown the same
        Dragon capsule to the International Space Station multiple times, with
        the first successful reuse occurring in June 2017.
